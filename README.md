# IP Generator

This project was designed to help a good sir study for the CCNA.
They kept asking me to make up IP Addresses so they could tell me
minutiae about them. Using the computer science idiom "never do
anything more than once", I instead wrote a pair of command line
programs to generate IPs and answer said minutiae.
